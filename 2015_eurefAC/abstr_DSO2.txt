abstract:
Dionysos Satellite Observatory and Higher Geodesy Laboratory of National Technical University of Athens have developed
an automated processing scheme to accommodate the daily analysis af all available continuous GNSS stations in Greece.

This daily analysis process is implemented for the last three years,
yielding results which help us further understand the complicated tectonic settings of Greece.

Last few months, processing platform, whithin the SEISMO project,
is in practice re-designed and re-implemented and upgraded to include more GNSS stations,
new processing capabilities, automated archiving and publishing of results and products.

At this time, reprocessing of all the available GNSS data up to date has begun using Bernese GNSS Software v 5.2.
Also, the daily analysis of final and rapid solution is in progress..?!!?E??
Results and products disseminated via a dedicated website.

In the immediate future planned the processing scheme will include new processing software (GAMIT, GIPSY) and τι ´αλλο??!!
