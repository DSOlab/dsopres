Abstract:
For the last few years, Dionysos Satellite Observatory (NTUA) has been routinely 
processing GNSS data to monitor ground deformation in Greece. During the last 
months, we have concentrated our efforts in contributing to EUREF's 
Densification Project via our dedicated processing platform.

Of crucial importance is the establishment of a network of GPS/GNSS stations, 
placed in Greece, which will provide a credible dataset; to this end, we have 
filtered a large set of inhomogenous stations, installed by various institutes 
to serve different scopes, to establish a geodetic quality network of reliable 
time span.

Our processing platform has been modernized, updated and enlarged to accommodate 
the efficient analysis of large GNSS datasets and the corresponding dissemination
of results and products. A large number of in-house software has been developed and
a database was designed to couple Bernese GNSS Software.

We are looking forward to a long term, fruitful cooperation with EUREF as well as
extending our contribution to other projects within the community.
